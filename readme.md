## What is Containerisation?
Containerization involves building self-sufficient software packages that perform consistently, regardless of the machines they run on.

Basically taking the snapshot of a machine, the filesystem and letting you use and deploy it as a construct.

## Images vs Containers
A Docker **image** behaves like a template from which consistent containers can be created. If Docker was a traditional virtual machine, the image could be likened to the ISO file used to install your VM. 
This isn't a robust comparison, **Docker differs from VMs** in terms of both concept and implementation, but it's a useful starting point nonetheless.

Images define the initial filesystem state of new containers. They bundle your application's source code and its dependencies into a self-contained package that' ready to use with a container runtime. Within the image, filesystem content is represented as multiple independent layers.

## Example

1. We have a file called `index.js`
2. To create a **container** from it: 
   1. Creating an image using `docker build .` 

- the `docker build .` command helps you to take this `index.js` file and **describe** what all do I need along with the file and create an image from it.

### What is an image?
- It contains the `index.js` file.
- It also contains that this is an image which should have `node.js` in it.
- This is an image which should have a filesystem in it.
- It should **expose** a certain PORT.



- **Containers** are when you actually run code locally.
`docker run <image_id>`

- You only create an image once.
